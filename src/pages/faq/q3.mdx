question: "Do I connect to Platform of Trust directly or to the data sources with specs defined by Platform of Trust?"

answer: "Platform of Trust does not collect any data; instead, it only saves the metadata that it needs for data transfer. Platform of Trust retrieves data from a producer, harmonises them and transfers them to a user."
