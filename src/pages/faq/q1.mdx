question: "Who owns the platform software?"

Because of its micro service architecture, the ownership of the Platform of Trust code is decentralised. Platform of Trust Oy owns the code developed for the platform, but it will be published as open code as far as possible. In addition, we obtain licences for using existing components on the platform, which are mostly based on open code.
