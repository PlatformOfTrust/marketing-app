Platform of Trust does not require systems to be released. Instead, companies can determine what data that they want to transmit or sell and to whom. There are various reasons for using the data. Organisations can use their and othersâ€™ data to make their current operations more efficient, generate new business, and make better decisions. Platform of Trust makes data and services available quickly and easily, thus boosting demand for service providers.
