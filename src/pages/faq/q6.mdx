question: "What is the format of digital twin frame on Platform of Trust?"
lang: "en-GB"

---

All items in the digital twin frames are presented according to the open harmonised data model that Platform of Trust applies. The model is based on commonly accepted international standards, such as the [IFC model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Foundation_Classes), where applicable. In technical terms, the digital twin frames are stored in a [graph database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database).
