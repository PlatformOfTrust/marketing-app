Like oil has been the essence of mobility and manufacturing industry as well as source for plastics, we tend to think data is the matching essence for the future. But. Oil is nonrenewable raw-material and causes problems that reflect long in to the future. Same problems, effective data usage can help solve.</p>\n<p>We seem to have two-sided take on data. We see it as a huge possibility but also it causes many sorts of fears. As individuals we share our personal data quite carefreely on the internet but at the same time we are very alert about our privacy. We realize that applications that use our data can make our lives easier, but we are afraid to give them control. A good example of this is the conversation about self-driving cars where the extreme opposites dominate the discussions: wheather the autonomous vehicles should be allowed on streets at all or should human drivers be removed all together and let these robots handle mobility of people and goods.</p>\n<p>Often you hear talking that there is too much data in the world. At the same time Artificial Intelligence algorithms are starving and companies don’t utilize even the data they produce from their own functions. Not to even mention the possibility of selling that data or sharing it with partners in order to develop business models.</p>\n<p>Data is absolutely useless if it’s not used. And it’s almost impossible to use it if data quality is not harmonized. Companies and organizations are afraid to use their data if they don’t know if they can trust the quality. Data economy clearly needs new players that can address these harmonizing and quality issues.</p>\n<p>Platform of Trust is this kind of player. It aims to turn data in to the raw-material of future business by harmonizing the data coming from different sources and organizations, by creating a faster and more agile way of co-operation by building a platform for data sharing and licensing. Trust, ownership of data and GDPR compliancy are on the base of the platform.</p>\n<p>Data is not the new oil but more like new water. Water circulates in the nature. Water alone is not enough but water and nutrients together make nature flourish. Water doesn’t pollute, neither. Let’s say data is the new water. And let’s learn to create new business where data is to economy what water is to nature.  </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Data is not the new oil","path":"/news/data-is-not-the-new-oil","date":"Tuesday 25 June 2019","tags":["Data"],"status":"published","type":"news","subtype":"blog"},"excerpt":"Data is often pictu…"}},{"node":{"id":"a0e5698c-6490-5fc1-89e5-8204fb01e6e6","html":"<p>The services available to residents will change everyday living. The new services will primarily be based on data collected about buildings and their use.</p>\n<p>Until now, the data have been fragmented and mutually incompatible, which has slowed down development. An experiment carried out on Platform of Trust proved that collaboration between operators in the construction and property sectors can help data flow more efficiently between them, enhancing their opportunities for using them.</p>\n<p>In autumn 2018, the Finnish companies Platform of Trust, Kojamo Oy, Visma Tampuuri and Lassila &#x26; Tikanoja conducted an experiment aimed at enabling the bidirectional flow of several operators’ system data. Platform of Trust was used as a common platform, thus eliminating the need for interfaces between individual operators.</p>\n<p>The platform was built with data harmonisation and unification in mind. The experiment was based on a construction-phase information model of a building at Karavaanikuja 2, Helsinki, that contained building and system data.</p>\n<p>A digital copy of the Kojamo building at Karavaanikuja 2, a demo application intended for residents, and interfaces with the Visma Tampuuri maintenance record system and Lassila &#x26; Tikanoja ERP system were created on the platform.</p>\n<p>The experiment showed that it was possible to achieve real-time updates of previously fragmented data between the operators and applications during a failure report process, for example.</p>\n<p><em>“It only took a couple of months to create a whole new digital service experience that connected the digital building copy, residents, the maintenance company and the owner. Platform of Trust demonstrated that existing system data can be used more efficiently without modifying the systems themselves. A one-off technical integration between the platform and a data source makes it possible to create a functional client application in weeks,”</em> says one of the masterminds behind Platform of Trust, <strong>Pirkka Frosti</strong> of Digital Living.</p>\n<p>The experiment generated a significant amount of new information on the use of data models and the practical use of data created in business operations.</p>\n<p>Platform of Trust aims to make service providers more efficient and speed up communication with residents or other end-users. Failure reports are a practical example of improved efficiency. Ideally, the location, make, age, condition and repair history of a faulty object is visible in all relevant operators’ systems. This eliminates the need to visit the site to check that repairs are needed, which make of the object needs to be repaired and which spare parts are needed. Instead of visiting a site 3 to 5 times, a repair technician can be sent to the location with all the necessary tools and parts at the right time. Information flows smoothly between all relevant companies, systems, and the resident. The experiment confirmed that in collaboration, it was possible to make this information flow in real time between parties.</p>\n<p><em>“In the property sector, data is often invisible and incompatible, slowing down the increased productivity made possible by digitalisation. By working together, we can solve this problem. The pilot was not limited to a few operators: instead, it demonstrated just how much the entire sector can up its game. The capabilities created on Platform of Trust and in the parties’ proprietary systems during the pilot period benefit everyone,”</em> says Chief Development Officer <strong>Teemu Suila</strong> of Kojamo.</p>\n<p>Platform of Trust is a community-based platform that will be launched in summer 2019. It provides an alternative to slow and expensive integration projects by using automation and data harmonisation to enable data flows between organisations and systems. The platform aims to promote collaboration and to create new business opportunities for all parties.</p>\n<p><em>“Platform of Trust helped Kojamo harmonise its fragmented data models, making the data flow and, most importantly, to use the data to create meaningful services for its customers. The platform proved it could bring systems, data, developers and users together and turn data into a component for creating new and innovative services quickly and efficiently. The pilot project allows other companies that join the project to speed up their processes and reduce costs,”</em> says Pirkka Frosti.</p>\n<p>The development of Platform of Trust began in 2018 as a collaborative project between operators in the property and construction sectors. The goal was to promote the harmonisation of the data these sectors use and to open up new business models. In the future, the platform will be available for operators in any sector. Platform of Trust Oy, a part of the Suomen Tilaajavastuu group, was incorporated in February 2019. Business Finland has granted Platform of Trust 5 million of funding for international expansion.</p>\n<p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>\n<h3>Further information</h3>\n<h4>Vesa Ilmarinen</h4>\n<p>Chief Impact Officer, Platform of Trust</p>\n<p>+358 40 508 6447</p>\n<p>vesa.ilmarinen@oftrust.net</p>\n<h4>Pirkka Frosti</h4>\n<p>Platform of Trust/Digital Living</p>\n<p>+358 50 524 5730</p>\n<p>pirkka.frosti@digitalliving.fi</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Collaboration can help effectively utilise fragmented data in the property sector","path":"/news/kojamo","date":"Friday 03 May 2019","tags":["Kojamo"],"status":"published","type":"news","subtype":"pressRelease"},"excerpt":"The services availa…"}},{"node":{"id":"e7b906b5-2904-586c-9c2d-3726f3c07bc8","html":"<p>In the future, the public sector will have to radically change how it operates to enable the customer focus, digitalisation, and overall coordination needed to organise and provide complex services.</p>\n<p>As resources become more limited, service provision and property must be assessed as a whole to decide on the kind and size of premises needed, as well as the investments and maintenance the premises require. Optimising the service network can significantly reduce costs and increase efficiency, thanks to increased functionality and more efficient use of premises.</p>\n<p>Locia CapaCity is a dynamic tool for service network planning that integrates information on the location and functionality of service points, people, and buildings. The information is automatically collected in a continuous data flow straight from the operative systems, after which it is integrated with external data sources and registers. The possibilities for more in-depth information on each service point are virtually unlimited with the help of sensor-based condition data, for example. The fact-based, almost real-time situation description of service network performance makes planning operations practically significantly easier. Forecast information is particularly important to urban planners when making long-term strategic plans. Decision-makers can use visualised data and clear indicators when making decisions on the service network.</p>\n<p>Dynamic service network planning allows users to create an up-to-date description of the regional over or under capacity of the service network and investment planning, and to revise the intake and occupancy rate of an individual service point, such as a nursery school. Digital life-cycle data will help schedule renovations proactively and avoid unnecessary investments in buildings that are going be taken out of the service network.\nThe collaboration between Platform of Trust and Locia will make it possible to enrich and exploit service network data using a trust-based ecosystem. The companies in the ecosystem benefit each other while creating value for their customers and partners. Platform of Trust helps the data flow smoothly and in the right proportion to Locia CapaCity, saving time and freeing up resources for using the data in service network planning.</p>\n<p>Platform of Trust is a community-based platform that will be launched in June. It harmonises data from a range of sources into a format that can be used by many operators. Data source validation and the use of automated authorisation and agreement tools will ensure data reliability. The development of the platform was begun to address the needs of the construction and property sectors. While the majority of the data on the platform in its initial phase is related to these sectors, in the future, the platform will be available for the needs of any sector.</p>\n<p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>\n<h3>More information</h3>\n<h4>Toni Luhti</h4>\n<p>Platform of Trust Oy</p>\n<p>+358 50 506 6327</p>\n<p>toni.luhti@oftrust.net</p>\n<h4>Emilia Rönkkö</h4>\n<p>Locia Oy</p>\n<p>+358 44 976 3620</p>\n<p>emilia@locia.fi</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Preventive overall management of premises and service networks for public organisations","path":"/news/locia","date":"Tuesday 09 April 2019","tags":["Locia"],"status":"published","type":"news","subtype":"article"},"excerpt":"In the future, the …"}}]}}}
